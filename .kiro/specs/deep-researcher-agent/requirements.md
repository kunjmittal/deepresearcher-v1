# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Deep Researcher Agent is a Python-based system designed to search, analyze, and synthesize information from large-scale data sources without relying on external web search APIs. The system will handle local embedding generation, multi-step reasoning, and provide efficient storage and retrieval capabilities for comprehensive research tasks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to submit complex queries to the system, so that I can receive comprehensive research results without depending on external APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a research query THEN the system SHALL accept and process the query using Python-based components
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL NOT make calls to external web search APIs
3. WHEN a query is received THEN the system SHALL return structured research results within a reasonable timeframe

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to generate embeddings locally, so that I can index and retrieve documents efficiently without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are added to the system THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings locally using Python libraries
2. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in an efficient local storage format
3. WHEN performing retrieval THEN the system SHALL use locally generated embeddings for similarity matching
4. WHEN indexing documents THEN the system SHALL support various document formats and extract meaningful content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to break down complex queries into smaller tasks, so that I can get more thorough and accurate research results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a complex query is received THEN the system SHALL decompose it into multiple sub-queries or research steps
2. WHEN performing multi-step reasoning THEN the system SHALL execute each step sequentially and build upon previous results
3. WHEN reasoning through steps THEN the system SHALL maintain context and coherence across all steps
4. WHEN completing multi-step analysis THEN the system SHALL synthesize results from all steps into a comprehensive response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want fast and accurate document retrieval, so that I can efficiently access relevant information from large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for documents THEN the system SHALL return results within acceptable response times even for large datasets
2. WHEN retrieving documents THEN the system SHALL rank results by relevance using embedding similarity
3. WHEN storing documents THEN the system SHALL use an efficient storage pipeline that supports quick retrieval
4. WHEN indexing new documents THEN the system SHALL update the retrieval system without significant performance degradation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to generate coherent research reports from multiple sources, so that I can get synthesized insights rather than just raw search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple relevant sources are found THEN the system SHALL summarize and synthesize the information into a coherent report
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL maintain source attribution and provide references
3. WHEN synthesizing information THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve conflicting information from different sources
4. WHEN creating summaries THEN the system SHALL preserve key insights and important details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to ask follow-up questions and refine my queries interactively, so that I can dig deeper into specific aspects of my research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL maintain context from previous queries in the session
2. WHEN refining queries THEN the system SHALL suggest related questions or areas for deeper investigation
3. WHEN conducting interactive sessions THEN the system SHALL allow users to explore different aspects of the research topic
4. WHEN providing follow-up responses THEN the system SHALL build upon previously gathered information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to understand how the system reached its conclusions, so that I can evaluate the reliability and reasoning behind the research results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating research results THEN the system SHALL provide explanations of its reasoning steps
2. WHEN performing multi-step analysis THEN the system SHALL show how each step contributed to the final conclusion
3. WHEN retrieving sources THEN the system SHALL explain why specific documents were selected as relevant
4. WHEN synthesizing information THEN the system SHALL indicate the confidence level and basis for conclusions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to export research results in structured formats, so that I can use the findings in reports, presentations, or further analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research is completed THEN the system SHALL support export to PDF format with proper formatting
2. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL support Markdown format for easy integration with documentation systems
3. WHEN generating exports THEN the system SHALL include source references, citations, and metadata
4. WHEN creating structured outputs THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and professional formatting
